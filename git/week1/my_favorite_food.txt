Tips for failproof kaju barfi
Here’s what you need to do so that you get it right the first time

Grind cashews in batches – This will help the cashews grind quickly and they’ll not release oil.
Sift through the cashew powder with your fingers to remove any cashew chunks. Alternatively, run it through a sieve.
Use a non-stick pan so that the cashew mixture doesn’t stick and burn.
Make sure to check for one-string consistency. This is what gives the barfi a crumbly texture.
Cook the cashew mixture on low heat to avoid burning.
Cook until the mixture leaves the sides of the pan and you are able to roll them into a ball.
Knead it to smoothen out the texture.
Wait for 15-20 minutes before cutting the barfi.
well, the recipe of kaju katli is popular across india, but there are different types and variations to the way it is prepared. the difference and variations would be in its thickness and the texture consistency. i tried to make it soft and sort of chewy in texture. but some prefer it to be hard like a barfi. it is purely controlled by the sugar syrup consistency. i have used the one string consistency and if you increase it to 2 or 3 it would be harder. kaju barfi has to be moist in my perspective, but you may slightly vary it as per your taste. moreover, you may also add some edible colour to the sugar syrup to make it more colourful. i have added the silver wok as you get in most of the bakery or halwai, but it is again purely optional.
