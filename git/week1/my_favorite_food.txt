Tips for failproof kaju barfi
Here’s what you need to do so that you get it right the first time

Grind cashews in batches – This will help the cashews grind quickly and they’ll not release oil.
Sift through the cashew powder with your fingers to remove any cashew chunks. Alternatively, run it through a sieve.
Use a non-stick pan so that the cashew mixture doesn’t stick and burn.
Make sure to check for one-string consistency. This is what gives the barfi a crumbly texture.
Cook the cashew mixture on low heat to avoid burning.
Cook until the mixture leaves the sides of the pan and you are able to roll them into a ball.
Knead it to smoothen out the texture.
Wait for 15-20 minutes before cutting the barfi.
